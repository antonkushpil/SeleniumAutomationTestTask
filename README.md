Test task for Test Automation Engineer position
When applying for a position of Senior Automation test engineer in one big company I was asked to write automation test examples for any website. I've chosen pinterest.com and wrote a few tests in BDD using Specflow and Selenium. Eventually, I've gotten an offer but chosen another company. 
P.S. I hope this example would be helpful for someone who just starts his automation career.
